## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> Rather than documenting there were bug fixes I worked on as well as small visual bugs as well. I have also spent a lot of time on authentication

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> This week's plan is to document a lot of what was done, cleaning the code, and finish the authentication and S3 work.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> There are no blockers at the moment.

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.

> I have been slipping a little bit because of time.
